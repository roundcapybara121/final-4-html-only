                        created mockups to visualize the changes I was going to make and then attempted to code those
                        changes into a responsive website.

                <p>I was extremely new to web developing and ran into trouble with coding parts of my code. Using online
                    tutorials, I figured out how to make the navigation bar responsive through media queuries and other
                    CSS tools. However, I couldn't quite figure out how to remove the background color of the icons.
                    Additionally, I had tried to use z-indexes in order to keep the navigation bar at the top, yet when
                    I uploaded the pages onto github, the images lay on top of the navigation bar when testing for
                    responsiveness.</p>

                <p>After my redesign was peer reviewed, these were the critiques I received:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="list-outer">
                        Site felt empty because of the white space on the sides and too much content was taken away.
                        <ul>
                            <li class="list-indent"></li>
                            <u>Idea</u>: I would spread the content out more so that there is less white space.
                            Additionally, a patterned background would aid in reducing the emptiness.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="list-outer">
                    The scroll issue does not seem to be fixed. Even after opening the collapse button, users still
                    have to scroll through a lot of information
                    <ul>
                        <li class="list-indent"></li>
                        <u>Idea</u>: I could put each review into a card that users can click to open. Then it would
                        reveal more information about the review.
                </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="list-outer">
                    One person noted that the white text on the orange background was hard to read.
                    <ul>
                        <li class="list-indent"></li>
                        <u>Idea</u>: I would have to further research into what colors would be appropriate for a new
                        design. In the future, I will consider colors that contrast better and put that into
                        webAim to reassess.
                </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="list-outer">
                    The website was not fully responsive. When viewed on the phone, users felt that the image would
                    block certain parts of the text.
                    <ul>
                        <li class="list-indent"></li>
                        <u>Idea</u>: I believe the reason behind this issue is that I did not use the media queries and
                        divs properly. I believe there was an issue with the padding or that I didn’t properly
                        divide the different components into their own divs, allowing them to overlap. To fix
                        this issue, I think I can put the image and the content into a container div, then
                        divide them further into their own, smaller wrappers. Then use display flex and justify
                        content in order to move them from being horizontal to vertical to each other.
                </li>

                    Users also noted that the design for the tablet was not too different from the desktop version
                    and would like to see something more catered towards tablet users.

                        <u>Idea</u>: I originally designed the tablet interface based off of the desktop interface.
                        After reviewing the aspects of a desktop compared to a tablet, I agree with the critique
                        in that the tablet should be seen as a bigger mobile device. In the future, I will
                        consider the limited use of the keyboard, and need for easy navigation. Additionally,
                        since desktops users have the capability for a more complex design, I will consider
                        making the experience more creative.

                <p>This project provided me invaluable insight into the different considerations that designers often
                    make. Though I did not create a design that fully satisfied users, I am glad that I was able to
                    learn how to make these improvements in the future.
