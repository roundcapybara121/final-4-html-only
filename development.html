                        interface components, and tie the components to an internal data state using React JS. I created a
                        list-based interface centered around buying plants.

                <h1>Why an online plant shop?</h1>
                <p>Nowadays, people go online to shop for everything -– from clothing to food. The main appeal of online
                    shops is that they are convenient. Online shops allow businesses to remove a mediator between the
                    seller and the buyer and streamline the checkout process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plants are often sold in small boutiques without an online presence. What if we were able to help
                    these small businesses flourish by pushing their services online?

                <h1 class="work-section-title">Understanding the design</h1>
                <h3>Basic Interations</h3>
                <p>Here are components to consider for a shop:</p>
                <p class="p-bold">Aggregator</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Something to tally up the total cost of plants &#8594;
                        allow customers to quickly know when they’ve reach their budget
                    </li>
                    <li>Something that keeps track of what plants are in the cart &#8594;
                        allow customers to quickly know what items they’ve added so far
                    </li>
                    <li>A way to remove items from the cart &#8594;
                        allow customers a way to recover from mistakes without having to restart the process
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="p-bold">Search Operations</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A way to sort the different plants &#8594; allows customers choose how to best search through
                        the different selections
                    </li>
                    <li>A way to filter between different properties of plants &#8594; allows customers to easily view
                        only the items that they want
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Vision Board</h3>
                <p>Take a look at what inspired my final design!</p>
                <p>What I noticed with these shops was that they had varying hues of green and a complementary color to contrast the green. This makes the overall look very pleasing to the eye. Additionally, the edges, corners, and font have a refined look to them by using rounded corners and bouncy font.</p>

                <h1 class="work-section-title">Let's Code</h1>
                <p>Let's take a look at how all the pieces of my code fit together</p>
                <p>The central use of React was in managing the different states of the items throughout the website.
                    This diagram gives a rough idea of how states change between parts of my code and user interactions

                <h1 class="work-section-title">Future Improvements</h1>
                <p>Here are things I would like to add if given more time for this project</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make the website more personalized by adding an “about” section into the header
                    </li>
                    <li>In case the store sold more items, add a search bar to allow searching for items by name
                    </li>
                    <li>Include tax and shipping costs in the aggregator
                    </li>
                    <li>Add more ways to filter. For example, by color, high or low water needed, or specific heights
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h1 class="work-section-title">Conclusion</h1>
                <p>React is a powerful tool in that we can manage states. This allows for us to code interactions such as button presses. In the future,  I hope to be able to utilize this tool further and create a more developed e-commerce platform. </p>
